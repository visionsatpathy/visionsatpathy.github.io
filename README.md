If you care about pushing the limits of imaging — higher resolution, deeper penetration, better SNR, and faster acquisition — you’re in the right place.

## What This Page Is About

Imaging systems do not fail because of hardware alone.  
They fail because we misunderstand their limits.

This page is dedicated to exploring:

- The **true limits of optical and computational resolution**
- The separation of **bulk motion vs intrinsic elastic response**
- Reconstruction beyond conventional assumptions
- Scattering-aware forward models
- Phase-sensitive detection in elastography
- The mathematics behind imaging — not just the implementation

If you’re interested in improving imaging systems at the level of physics, signal processing, and reconstruction theory — not just applying deep learning blindly — this space is for you.

## Core Research Themes

### 1. Optical Coherence Elastography (OCE)

- Phase-sensitive motion detection
- Bulk motion removal under translation, rotation, bending, and vibration
- Universal elastographic profiling frameworks
- Elastic resolution vs optical resolution
- Low-frequency excitation (~10 Hz regime)
- Millipascal-scale modulus estimation challenges

---

### 2. Reconstruction Resolution vs Optical Resolution

Understanding that:

- Optical resolution is hardware-defined  
- Reconstruction resolution is model-defined  

This page explores:

- Indirect vs direct imaging methods  
- Scattering-aware reconstruction  
- Tomographic inversion strategies  
- Resolution limits in microscopy, spectroscopy, and tomography  

---

### 3. Scattering Models and Depth Limits

Can better scattering models:

- Extend imaging depth?
- Improve reconstruction stability?
- Increase effective SNR?
- Enhance elastic contrast sensitivity?

We explore forward models beyond simplistic assumptions.

### 4. Computational Imaging Without AI Hype

Not every problem needs a neural network.

Focus areas:

- Phase extraction via DCT
- Optical flow for elastic motion analysis
- Radiometric modeling
- Deterministic reconstruction methods
- Transform-domain signal processing

AI is a tool — not a substitute for physics.

---

### 5. Imaging System Architecture

Common structure across advanced optical systems:

1. Source
2. Beam shaping / relay optics
3. Gating / modulation strategy
4. Interaction model
5. Detector
6. Reconstruction algorithm

The innovation often lies in the coupling between 4 and 6.

## Long-Term Vision

To contribute toward imaging systems that:

- Quantify mechanical properties with precision  
- Separate structure from mechanics  
- Overcome conventional depth limits  
- Bridge physics, mathematics, and computation  

And possibly — solve problems that have remained untouched not because they are impossible, but because they require deeper thinking.
