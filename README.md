## Imaging Beyond the Apparent  
### Separating what moves from what matters.

If you care about pushing the limits of imaging —  
higher resolution, deeper penetration, better SNR, faster acquisition —  
you’re in the right place.

But this page is not about incremental improvements.

It is about understanding what an imaging system is *actually* measuring.

## 🔍 The Core Question

When light interacts with matter, what are we truly detecting?

- Structure?
- Motion?
- Elasticity?
- Scattering?
- Or artifacts of our own reconstruction models?

Most imaging systems mix these together.

This work focuses on **separating them.**

## 🧩 Theme 1 — Resolution Is Not What You Think

Optical resolution ≠ Reconstruction resolution.

Hardware defines one limit.  
Mathematics defines another.  
Physics defines the real one.

This space explores:

- Transform-domain phase extraction (DCT-based approaches)
- Reconstruction resolution vs optical resolution
- Model-aware inversion
- Elastic resolution in phase-sensitive systems
- Depth limits under realistic scattering

---

## 🌊 Theme 2 — Motion vs Mechanics

In Optical Coherence Elastography:

Bulk motion contaminates elastic signals.

Translation, rotation, bending, vibration —  
all masquerade as elasticity.

The goal:

> Build universal frameworks that separate geometric motion from intrinsic mechanical response.

## 🌫 Theme 3 — Scattering Is Not Noise

Scattering:

- Limits depth
- Alters phase
- Affects SNR
- Modifies apparent contrast

But scattering is also information.

The question is not:
"How do we ignore it?"

The question is:
"How do we model it correctly?"

## 🛠 Engineering Meets Physics

Every imaging system follows this pipeline:

1. Source  
2. Optical delivery  
3. Interaction with matter  
4. Detection  
5. Reconstruction  

The true innovation lies between **interaction and reconstruction**.

This page focuses on that junction.

## 🚫 Not Just Another AI Page

Deep learning is powerful.

But:

- If the forward model is wrong, AI learns the wrong mapping.
- If physics is ignored, reconstruction becomes decoration.

This work prioritizes:

- Deterministic modeling
- Radiometric understanding
- Phase-sensitive analysis
- Physics-first computation

AI is a tool — not a shortcut.

## 🎯 Who Should Be Here

You might belong here if:

- You think resolution is more than Rayleigh’s criterion.
- You care about separating bulk motion from elastic deformation.
- You question depth limits instead of accepting them.
- You want to improve imaging at the level of physical modeling.
- You believe serious imaging requires mathematics.

---

## 🚀 Long-Term Direction

To develop imaging systems that:

- Quantify biomechanics reliably  
- Separate structure from mechanics  
- Improve depth without sacrificing resolution  
- Treat scattering as a modeled variable, not noise  

Not incremental.

Fundamental.
